## ParsedownExtra for Laravel
Imagine [this](https://github.com/parsedown/laravel) but it was [ParsedownExtra](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown-extra). This is what that is.

Same usage, same documentation, same license, same copyrights. Just swap `Parsedown` for `ParsedownExtra` as the namespace.

No test suites available. Not published on Packagist. Require this as a SVC repository in your Composer file. Sorry.
